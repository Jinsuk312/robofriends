This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We are consuming the JSONPlaceholder API(for dummy user data) to display user data and the ROBOHASH API to generate images for each user. There is also a search bar that lets you filter through the names of the users.
